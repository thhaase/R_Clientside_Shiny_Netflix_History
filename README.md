# R_Clientside_Shiny_Netflix_History

With the help of [this Tutorial](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/shinylive-r) I published my little [Netflix-Plots Dashboard Project](https://github.com/thhaase/Netflix_History_Dashboard) as a clientside Application via Github Pages. 

Despite the downside of **extremely long** time it takes to load this is by far the better method for publishing small apps like this one for friends or colleagues then using shinyapps.io (like i did before). 

Its almost as fast to deploy and because of the the nature of the shiny-server being clientside its possible to make your project public. 

Here is the Link for the Dashboard: https://thhaase.github.io/R_Clientside_Shiny_Netflix_History/
